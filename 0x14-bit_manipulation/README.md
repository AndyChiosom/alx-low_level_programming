Bit manipulation in C programming refers to the manipulation of individual bits within a binary representation of data. It involves performing various operations at the bit level, such as setting, clearing, toggling, or checking the state of specific bits in an integer or other data types.

Bit manipulation is often used in scenarios where memory efficiency or optimization is crucial. It allows programmers to perform operations on individual bits rather than entire bytes or larger units, which can be more efficient in terms of memory usage and execution time.
