Binary code and bit manipulation are fundamental concepts in computer science and digital electronics, serving as the foundation for all digital computing systems. 
In binary code, information is represented using just two symbols: 0 and 1, making it the simplest numerical system. Each digit in a binary number is referred to as a "bit," which stands for "binary digit."
 Bit manipulation involves the manipulation of individual bits or groups of bits within binary data. It plays a crucial role in various computer operations, including data storage, arithmetic, logic, and communication.
 Bitwise operations such as AND, OR, XOR, and NOT enable programmers to control and modify specific bits within binary numbers efficiently. Bit manipulation is widely used for various purposes, including: 1. Data Compression: Techniques like.
