In Linux and other Unix-like operating systems, a file descriptor is a fundamental idea. The standard input (stdin), standard output (stdout), and standard error (stderr) devices are just a few examples of input/output (I/O) devices that can be accessed using this special integer identifier.
File descriptors are essential for controlling and managing data streams inside of processes.
