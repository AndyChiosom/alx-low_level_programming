File input/output (I/O) refers to the process of reading from and writing to files on a computer. In most programming languages, including C, file I/O is essential for tasks such as reading data from external files, writing data to files, or modifying existing files.

In C, file I/O operations are facilitated through the use of the <stdio.h> library, which provides functions for file handling. Here's a brief overview of how to perform file I/O operations in C:

It takes two arguments: the file name (along with the path, if necessary) and the mode in which the file will be accessed ("r" for reading, "w" for writing, "a" for appending, etc.). Example:
